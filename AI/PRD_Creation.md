# Creating PRD for Project Base Code

---

**User**

Let's make prd to this project here is the base code @Blurr-Tech-assessment and here is the requirnemt for this project
T ech Stack:
Frontend: React + tailwind + shadcn + Prisma
Backend: NextJs server actions, no separate backend service or api needed.
Database: SQLite
Authentication: Next authJs
Objective:
Carefully read the following user story and build a production ready React application that implements the
specified functionality.
Your task involves creating a robust frontend solution for the Blurr HR Prortal, enabling users to efficiently
manage their employees and their projects.
General Rules:
You are expected to heavily use AI in the process, use CursorAI, windsurfAI or any other agentic AI tools to
help you with the task.
use AI for Everything, you will be judged on your skills to produce the best code with AI, to navigate and guid
the AI to generate structured high quality meaningful production ready code.
We believe AI is the Future, and the skill to harness it's power is crucial to the success.
Context:
At Blurr, we provide systems to help companies automate their workflow and increase their value, we
consider ourselves to be the success partners for our customers to help them overcome their pain pints and
eleminate pipelines bottleneck.
User Story:
As a user of Blurr HR Portal, I want to efficiently manage my employees, calculate their salaries and track
projects and tasks.
Acceptance Criteria:
●
Users can login / signup to the portal
●
Portal has two main sections
Employees Section:
●
Users can add and manage employees within their organization.
●
Each employee has fields for basic employee information: Employee Id, Name, Joining Date, Basic Salary.
●
A salary table displays a list of employees and their corresponding salary details.
●
User can pick a month to generate the salary table
●
User can add bonus and deductible to each employee the salary table, to be automatically calculated in
their payable amount
Project Section:
●
User can Add, manage projects
●
User can add add tasks to the projects
●
Tasks will have needed fields: Title, Description, priority, assigned to, status
●
User can assign employee to the task
●
Kanban board to display the tasks by their status
●
Backlog table to display all the tasks
Additional Extra Task:
● Create an AI chatbot the user can ask to get informations about his tasks and projects
Additional Notes and remarks:
●
●
●
●
Use AI to chat and discuss how to put the best architecture for this project, and how to approach this
task
Plan carefully, You Ask AI to detail each task, and explore technical implementation for each, adjust
technical implementations as you see fit.
Save the Details for each task as md file in the AI directory, you can use this each time you prompt the AI
to work on a feature, Keep those in the git, we would like to asses them, see how you think and how you
have successfully managed to put the best plan and architecture for the project.
We are interested in seeing how you come up with solutions for the problems, how you will solve them
and you think about it, how you search them and divide large ambiguous tasks into digestable easy to
implement technical format

I've created a comprehensive PRD document that outlines all aspects of the Blurr HR Portal project. The document covers:

1. Project Overview and Purpose
2. Technical Stack details
3. Core Features including:
   - Authentication System
   - Employee Management
   - Project Management
   - AI Chatbot Integration
4. User Interface Requirements
5. Database Schema
6. Security Requirements
7. Performance Requirements
8. Implementation Phases
9. Testing Strategy
10. Deployment Strategy
11. Maintenance and Support
12. Success Metrics

Now that we have a clear PRD, we can proceed with the implementation. Would you like to:

1. Start with setting up the project structure and basic configuration?
2. Begin with the authentication system implementation?
3. Focus on a specific feature from the PRD?

Please let me know which aspect you'd like to tackle first, and I'll help you implement it step by step.

**User**

put the prd file in AI directory 

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you move the PRD file to the AI directory. First, let me check if the AI directory exists.


I'll create the AI directory and move the PRD file there.


Now, I'll move the PRD file from the docs directory to the AI directory.


Let me verify that the file has been moved successfully.


Perfect! I've successfully:
1. Created a new `AI` directory
2. Moved the `PRD.md` file from the `docs` directory to the `AI` directory

The PRD file is now located in the AI directory as requested. Would you like to proceed with implementing any specific part of the project?

---

**User**

let's edit the prd 
let's start with point 3.1, it's not role based becuase the users are the system admin

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you modify section 3.1 of the PRD to reflect that the system is for system administrators only, removing the role-based access control aspect.


```markdown
// ... existing code ...
### 3.1 Authentication System
- System administrator registration and login
- Secure session management
- Password recovery system
- Single admin access (one admin per organization)
// ... existing code ...
```

I've updated section 3.1 to:
1. Changed "User registration and login" to "System administrator registration and login"
2. Removed "Role-based access control" since it's not needed
3. Added "Single admin access (one admin per organization)" to clarify the access model

This change better reflects that the system is designed for system administrators who will manage the entire HR portal for their organization. Would you like to make any other modifications to the PRD?

---

**User**

remove all role-based access control 

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you remove all mentions of role-based access control from the PRD. I'll need to update several sections.


```markdown
// ... existing code ...
### 1.2 Target Users
- System Administrators

// ... existing code ...
### 5.1 Core Tables
- Users
- Employees
- Projects
- Tasks
- Salaries
- Departments

### 5.2 Relationships
- Project-Tasks (1:N)
- Employee-Tasks (1:N)
- Department-Employees (1:N)

// ... existing code ...
### 6.1 Authentication
- Secure password storage
- JWT token management
- Session handling
- Single admin access control

// ... existing code ...
```

I've made the following changes to remove all role-based access control references:

1. Updated section 1.2 (Target Users) to only list "System Administrators"
2. Removed "Roles" from section 5.1 (Core Tables)
3. Removed "User-Employee (1:1)" relationship from section 5.2 since we're not dealing with multiple user roles
4. Changed "Role-based access control" to "Single admin access control" in section 6.1 (Authentication)

These changes better reflect that the system is designed for a single system administrator per organization, without any role-based access control. Would you like to make any other modifications to the PRD?
